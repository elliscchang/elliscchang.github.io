Hey! My name is Ellis Chang and I'm a 3rd year transfer at the University of California, San Diego, majoring in Computer Engineering and I'm in Warren College graduating Spring 2021. I am an aspiring Software Engineer/Hardware Engineer that eventually wants to own a startup in the future. I was never really into programming until I was in my community college. I knew I wanted to become an engineer when I grew up and I found my love and passion for computers after learning how to build my own computer in high school.

You can visit my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ellis-chang/) to see more about my background. I have a passion for learning new things that interest me. I'm always trying to gain more knowledge about different programming languages and always trying to improve my knowledge in those languages!

This is a quote that I live by:

>"Stay hungry, stay foolish." - Steve Jobs

and the moto I live by is ```nothing is impossible```.
